About
============
Nowadays in a competitive market, several vendors sell the same products and everyone has their own price so it will difficult to manage multiple RFQ's at a time even in odoo there is no kind of feature where you can manage multiple requests for quotations in a single list. Currently in odoo vendor can see a purchase order, the vendor can't able to see RFQ this module provides vendor to see RFQ, where the vendor can change the price from portal or website for RFQ's. You can see tender portal details from RFQ. You can sort by RFQ by newest, name & total. You can sort filter purchase orders by all, request for quotation & sent. You can communicate in RFQ chatter. This module helps in the online signature in the RFQ at the portal. You send RFQ and vendor view it, they accept and sign online. All changes automatically update in odoo backend.
