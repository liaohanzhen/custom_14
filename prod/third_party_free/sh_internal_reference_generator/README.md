About
============
Currently, in odoo, there is no way to generate automatically internal reference with customization. Our this module will provide that feature, where you can create a pattern for internal reference of product. You can create or customize internal reference using the product name, sequence, category, attribute with separators. Also, you can set auto-generate internal references while creating a new product.
