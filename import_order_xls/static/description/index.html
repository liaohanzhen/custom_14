		This module can be exceptionally beneficial for the persons who are wholesalers & retailers whereas they need to add 200-300 products in one order. Customer generally provides their large orders via Excel file with the Product code & Qty. So with minor modifications in that excel file Sales person can directly import this file into Sale order in Odoo. This will save their lots of time. We have also taken care that csv file creates problem as platform changes from MAC to windows. That's why our module accepts Excel file. Generally end user like sales persons are not so much aware with csv and it's separators. With our module, they can work mainly in Excel worksheets and upload that worksheets to Odoo. So with our module they can import large order in fraction of seconds and even more they can do mass update quickly in Sale order.

		Sometimes sales person includes 12 (dozen) Qty by default in their orders to customers. In this kind of cases they just need to know the product code from ERP system. With keeping this case in consideration, we made our module so simple specially for users like salesman so that if they add only Code in excel file then system will take default Qty automatically from settings. So there is no need to even provide Qty while importing file. In order to set default Qty, user need to go to Settings >> Configuration >> Sales menu & find the key "Defauly Qty To Import Product" and set the value as per their requirement.

		When there is large order with typically 200-300 order lines, it is very hard & time consuming to do modifications in Discount, Unit Price, or Qty in Order lines. With this case in consideration, through our module, you can export the order line in Excel file, do changes quickly in Excel and import that file back to sale order. Your whole order will be updated in fraction of seconds. If you want to modify the existing lines, then don't remove "ID" column in exported Excel file.
